# epipong-table

## What is this project?
This project is a nice steel coffee table with a game built in.
Unlike other entertaining coffee tables, this one can only play one game.
You may ask why?
This table has actually moving mechanical parts inside just like a pinball.
Therefore it can only play one game.

## Renders

## Software used
The CAD software used is SOLIDWORKS 2016. I made all the parts (except the screws and hinges) myself.
It took a long time and a lot of revisions.
The Slicing software to print the parts is Repetier host.
The EDA (the software to make PCBs) is Labcenter's Proteus.

## Bits of Advice
If I would make this project again, here are the main changes I would apply.
User plywood for the structure. Sure steel tubing is nice but warps when welded.
The paint I used was also too thin. Powder coating should have been used.
The inner "cart" is made up of steel tubing welded together. For this, Extruded aluminum T-tracks are preferable. 
The Igus tracks are not very suited for this, maybe a ball-bearing track is more appropriate.
The Motors and their drivers are undersized. Bigger ones are required.

## State of the project.
This project is dead. 
I pulled the plug because it was too much money and a bad conception overall.
The Epitech's adm who promised to fund this project never did.
The management has changed drastically and this also participated at the end of the project.
And finally, I no longer live close to Marseille and this was the final nail in the coffin.
